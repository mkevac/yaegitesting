# yaegitesting
Small repo for testing [yaegi](https://godoc.org/github.com/containous/yaegi/cmd/goexports) interpreter.

The idea is that we have some user database with decent amount of users in it.
Users have some fixed fields like age, gender and some amount of custom fields
that are just int32 and each of these has an id.

And then we want to filter these users somehow.
And this filtering algorithm can change often.

We can implement it in code or we can ask user of this service to give us
filtering algorithm in request.

Ideally we need JIT compiled language for speed, but LUAJIT (lua interpreter)
and V8 (JavaScript interpreter) are not very performant because of cgo overhead.

I wanted to try yaegi for this purpose.
